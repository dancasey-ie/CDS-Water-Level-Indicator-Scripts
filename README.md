# CDS-Water-Level-Indicator-Scripts
Scripts developed during Copernicus Climate Data Store Adaptation Application course

Notes:
-------------
* The output of the scripts are HTML interactive Plolty.py charts that can be opened in your browser
* As the ERA5, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 are for different time periods it doesn't make for the most informative of charts
